The
Muffin
Man
is
seated
in
the
laboratory
of
The
Utility
Muffin
Research
Kitchen.
Reaching
for
an
oversized
chrome
spoon
he
gathers
an
intimate
quantity
of
dried
muffin
remnants
and,
brushing
his
scapular
aside,
proceeds
to
dump
these
inside
of
his
shirt.
He
turns
to
us
and
speaks:
"Some
people
like
cupcakes
better.
I,
for
one,
care
less
for
them."
Arrogantly
twisting
the
sterile
canvas
snoot
of
a
fully
charged
icing
anointment
utensil,
he
poots
forth
a
quarter-ounce
green
rosette
near
the
summit
of
a
dense
but
radiant
muffin
of
his
own
design.
Later
he
says:
"Some
people...
some
people
like
cupcakes
exclusively,
while
myself,
I
say
there
is
naught,
nor
ought
there
be,
nothing
so
exalted
on
the
face
of
god's
gray
earth
as
that
prince
of
foods:
the
muffin."
