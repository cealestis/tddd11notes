No
man
is
an
island
entire
of
itself.
Every
man
is
a
piece
of
the
continent,
a
part
of
the
main.
If
a
clod
be
washed
away
by
the
sea,
Europe
is
the
less.
As
well
as
if
a
promontory
were.
As
well
as
any
manner
of
thy
friends,
or
thine
own
were.
Each
man's
death
diminshes
me,
for
I
am
involved
in
mankind.
And
therefore
send
not
to
know
for
whom
the
bell
tolls.
It
tolls
for
thee.
